You will need to install the AR or VR plugin for your device which falls outside of
this guide.

This add on should be installed in the addons/godot-xr-tools subfolder of your project.
Note that the repository contains this folder and you should copy that folder over to
your project. If you're downloading this add on from the asset library make sure to
only add this subfolder to your project!

There is a project underway in Godot that will allow us to restructure this repository
so the add on subfolder is the root of this repository which will allow you to
submodule the add on.
